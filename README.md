# Python4Kids

The aim of this project is to create a remote repository available at the time of giving workshops to children at elementary schools from Puerto Rico and to maintain a global version for their future reference. It includes a series of basic Python scripts that cover the essential tools for learning how to program and how to think like a programmer. This project is sponsored by the Partnership for Research and Education Program (PREM) from the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao.

## Getting Started

To start using these scripts you will need to clone the repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/jordancaraballo/python4Kids
```

Once you have this done, you can use any text editor or Python IDE to run the scripts. To know about how to install or how to run any of these scripts you can visit https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors. For the purpose of this workshop students will be guided on how to run Python and dependencies like text editors will be already installed in the systems.

## Running the tests

The majority of the scripts were written individually without no dependency between each other. In order to run any of these scripts you can either use the Python IDE of your preference, or use the terminal in a Linux system by typing:

```
python ./scriptName.py
```
